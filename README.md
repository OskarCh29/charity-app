```

2. Application is integrated with `FreeCurrencyAPI` to provide real time exchange rates when transferring money between box and accounts.
Ensure that you provide free api-key.
3. After getting your api-key, navigate to the `application.yaml` file located in the `resources` folder. By the moment, key is provided as environmental viable from IDE.
- For safety, purpose provides api-key as environmental variable from IDE or as system variable. 
- Name of the environmental variable - `EXCHANGE_KEY`
4. Application uses flyway migration and H2 in a memory database. Application is prepared to work with basic currencies provided in `V2__add_currency.sql` file located in `resources/db/migration` folder. For deleting, inserting currencies modify this file.
5. When finished configuration runs the application with your IDE or with command window and maven:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
* Be aware that the application has an own validation system which prevents input invalid currencies. Migration file is determinate which currencies are valid for app environment.
